/*
    Goal for this module.

    1. Develop an agent program built using agent factories.
    2. Make agents a composition of 4 systems: DAMS
        Data, Messaging, Scheduling, Actions
    3. Ensure data flow goes from M->D, D<->S, S->A
        Messaging system transforms incoming messages and delivers them to the Data system
        Data system and Scheduling system 
    4. Connect agents D,A,M,S; D',A',M',S' via a connection between A -> M'

 /*
    What code do we have already?
        I've made several partial versions of similar systems. In this repo are a set of modules used to develop
